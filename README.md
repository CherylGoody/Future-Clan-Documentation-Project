# Future-Clan-Participant-Project
## Overview
This is my first official data analysis project. The data set used was obtained onsite from participants of the data analysis class during the Future Clan Bootcamp. This project aims at uncovering insights from the participants' data set through the analysis of their demographics and other parameters in the data set to enable entire class better understand their categories, similarities as well as their differences.

### Data Source
 The data set used is a google sheet data set and was primarily sourced from an online service [Google Sheet} (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1slHSvA-UtOkseFsfuJJZiOL222vusWt6xEbFOXYxElQ/edit#gid=1248562073)
